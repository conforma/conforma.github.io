This talk explores how Conforma leverages Sigstore signatures, in-toto attestations, and other tamper-proof sources to enforce organizational policies. The presentation focuses on the Tekton ecosystem and covers:

- The critical importance of ensuring container images meet organizational policies
- How Conforma enforces policies using secure, tamper-proof sources  
- Configuring policies to validate that specific Tekton Tasks (like code scanners) have been executed during the container image build process

*Perfect for those familiar with Sigstore who want to understand how to go beyond simple signature checks to comprehensive image validation.*
